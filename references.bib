	Abstract = {As coeditors, we wrote this inaugural department column to offer a working, evolving definition of digital literacies. We attempted to mediate the compelling theoretical work in this area with the realties of schools, standards, and dominant policies that sometimes impede progress with technologies that support teaching and learning. The authors that follow in this volume year are recognized scholars interested in how digital literacies practices shape, and are shaped by, youth inside and outside of school and how these practices can be supported by educators. We can touch only the surface of this rapidly changing topic within this volume year, but we hope this department helps readers of the Journal of Adolescent {\&} Adult Literacy ( JAAL) think about digital literacies further, peruse resources (we selected some current ones from the wealth available), and work to incorporate instructional frameworks and practices into classrooms, schools, and districts.},

	Abstract = {A comparison of 10th graders' reading of a narrative, literary text on a Sony e-reader and in print showed that preferences for reading devices are related to gender and to general reading habits.One hundred forty-three students participated in the study. In a school setting, students were asked to begin reading a novel on one device and then continue reading the same novel on the other device. A survey was administered before and after the reading session, measuring reading habits in general, device preferences, and experiences with screen and paper reading. Results showed that, overall, most students preferred reading on the e-reader. This preference was particularly strong among boys and reluctant readers, whereas avid readers were more in favor of print. Implications of these findings to library policies and priorities are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Objective: To explore effects of the technological interface on reading comprehension in a Norwegian school context. Participants: 72 tenth graders from two different primary schools in Norway. Method: The students were randomized into two groups, where the first group read two texts (1400-2000 words) in print, and the other group read the same texts as PDF on a computer screen. In addition pretests in reading comprehension, word reading and vocabulary were administered. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to investigate to what extent reading modality would influence the students' scores on the reading comprehension measure. Conclusion: Main findings show that students who read texts in print scored significantly better on the reading comprehension test than students who read the texts digitally. Implications of these findings for policymaking and test development are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In the course of digitisation, the range of substrates for textual reading is being expanded to include a number of screen-based technologies and reading devices, such as e-readers (e.g. Kindle) and tablets (e.g. iPad). These technologies have distinctly different affordances than paper has. Given that textual reading is at the same time likely to remain important as a cultural practice, and is undergoing massive change as digital screens are supplementing paper -- with the potential to re-place it as the dominant substrate -- there is an urgent need to investigate what effects such change might have on the reading of different kinds of texts, for dif-ferent purposes. This article proposes the need for an integrative, transdisciplinary model of embodied, tex-tual reading accounting for its psychological, ergo-nomic, technological, social, cultural and evolutionary aspects. The envisaged model aims to be partly explan-atory, in the sense that it aligns and integrates existing knowledge, and partly exploratory, in the sense that it points to blank spots in our knowledge where further research is needed. The model will thus serve to guide the planning of such further research, and to make re-search more compatible and research outcomes more widely useable.},

	Abstract = {Purpose -- This study attempts to investigate reading behavior in the digital environment by analyzing how people's reading behavior has changed over the past ten years. Design/methodology/approach -- Survey and analysis methods are employed. Findings -- With an increasing amount of time spent reading electronic documents, a screen-based reading behavior is emerging. The screen-based reading behavior is characterized by more time spent on browsing and scanning, keyword spotting, one-time reading, non-linear reading, and reading more selectively, while less time is spent on in-depth reading, and concentrated reading. Decreasing sustained attention is also noted. Annotating and highlighting while reading is a common activity in the printed environment. However, this ``traditional'' pattern has not yet migrated to the digital environment when people read electronic documents. Originality/value -- Implications for the changes in reading behavior are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested. Reading, Behaviour, Print media, Electronic media Paper},

	Abstract = {The "International Handbook of Research in Children's Literacy, Learning and Culture" presents a careful distillation of the current research in the field of primary years literacy studies. Well known contributors critically review and synthesize seminal studies on various themes, offer fresh perspectives and conceptualizations, and point to new directions for further investigation and study. Chapters vividly illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary educational thinking and research on literacy by offering perspectives from a wide range of disciplines--from aesthetics and anthropology to cultural psychology and curriculum theory. Literacy topics are addressed in three sections, namely 'society, culture, and community', 'school, culture, and pedagogy', and 'teachers, culture, and identity'. In presenting cutting-edge knowledge on all aspects of literacy learning in the primary/elementary school years, the "International Handbook of Research in Children's Literacy, Learning and Culture" provides an essential resource for scholars, educators, and researchers in charting the future of the increasingly important field of literacy in the 21st century.},

In a 2 (medium: booklet vs. iPad) by 2 (paratext: fiction vs. nonfiction) between-subjects factorial design, the study combined state oriented measures of narrative engagement and a newly developed measure of interface interference. Results indicated that, independently of prior experience with reading on electronic media, readers in the iPad condition reported dislocation within the text and awkwardness in handling their medium. Also, iPad readers who believed they were reading non-fiction were less likely to report narrative coherence and transportation, while booklet readers who believed they were reading nonfiction were, if anything, more likely to report narrative coherence. Finally, booklet (but not iPad) readers were more likely to report a close association between transportation and empa-thy.
